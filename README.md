<h3>About OpenLitterMap</h3>
<hr>
<p>OpenLitterMap is an open, interactive, and accessible database of the world's litter and plastic pollution.</p>
<p>We are building a fun data-collection experience to harness the unprecedented potential of citizen scientists around the world.</p>
<p>We believe that science on pollution should be an open, transparent and democratic process- not limited or controlled by anyone or any group.</p>
<p>If you would like to help shape the future of OpenLitterMap, we would love to have you in our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/openlittermap/shared_invite/zt-fdctasud-mu~OBQKReRdC9Ai9KgGROw">Slack Channel</a></p>
<p>Every Thursday, 6pm Irish time, we run a community zoom call for ~1 hour where anyone interested in OpenLitterMap can listen in to learn more, and share ideas to help the future direction of the platform.</p>
<p>OpenLitterMap is underdeveloped, but we are a community of over 3,600 contributors who have crowdsourced more than 100,000 uploads from 80 countries.</p>
<p>All of our data is available to explore on the <a href="https://openlittermap.com/global">Global Map</a> and more sophisticated <a href="https://openlittermap.com/world/The%20Netherlands/Zuid-Holland/Wassenaar/map">"city grid maps"</a> are also available to explore. Anyone can download all of our data for free.</p>
<hr>
<p>We have just launched a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/openlittermap-a-revolutionary-app-to-map-litter">GoFundMe</a> which includes our first promotional video and a new demo video showing how to use our app.</p>
<p>The source code for the mobile app (React Native) will launch soon, followed by the OpenLitterAI and our smart contacts.</p>
<p>OpenLitterMap is the first project to reward users with cryptocurrency for the production of geographic information. By using the app and doing "proof of work", users are "mining" Littercoin which we are experimenting with to reward and incentivize the sharing of geospatial data on plastic pollution.</p>
<br>
<p>STAY TUNED FOR LOTS OF EXCITING UPDATES</p>
<hr>
<p>OpenLitterMap/react-native is built with... <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native!</a>.
<p>You can set up <a href="https://github.com/OpenLitterMap/openlittermap-web">openlittermap-web</a> as a backend to test all its features with ease.</p>

<p>Have fun and thanks for taking an interest in OpenLitterMap</p>
